Let’s see if you can handle what you started. Receiver: Say whatever you want. You’re about to learn that I don’t back down. Sender: Oh I’m shaking. You talk big but all I see is someone desperate to look tough. \n",

Receiver: Your shadows are nothing but fear masquerading as strength. The Legion will burn away every twisted doctrine your Order spreads. Sender: You cling to that naive radiance like it protects you. The Obsidian Order’s rise is inevitable. Oppose us  and you’ll be swept aside with the rest of the deluded. Receiver: We don’t bow to tyrants hiding behind darkness. If it’s a clash of convictions you want the Legion stands ready. We won’t let your corruption swallow the realm. \n"
